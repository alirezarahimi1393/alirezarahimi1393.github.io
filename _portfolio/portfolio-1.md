Objective
:   Identifying potential drug candidates for rare diseases through advanced data analysis.

Approach
:   using machine learning to the analysis of various biological data (genes, proteins, metabolites) to identify medications that can target the underlying causes of rare diseases.

Duration
:   November 2023 - Present

Significance
:    seeking to repurpose current medications for use in treating uncommon diseasesâ€”a field that pharmaceutical corporations usually avoid due to its low profit margin.
